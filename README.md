## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 14
- React
- TypeScript
- Material-UI (MUI)
- DayJS for date handling

### Backend
- Next.js API Routes
- Prisma ORM
- SQLite Database

### External Services

- AWS S3 for file storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management-app.git
cd project-management-app
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

# Next Auth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

4. Initialize the database
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Features in Detail

### Project Management
- Create and track projects
- Set project status (Planning, In Progress, Completed, On Hold)
- Manage project budgets
- Track project locations
- Schedule and manage appointments

### Appointment System
- Schedule different types of appointments:
  - Initial Consultation
  - Site Visit

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Optimize image loading with next/image
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use service workers for caching

### Backend Optimization
- Implement database indexing
- Use connection pooling
- Implement API response caching
- Optimize database queries
- Use server-side pagination

### Caching Strategy
- Browser caching
- API response caching
- Static asset caching
- Database query caching
- Session caching

## Deployment Guidelines

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Staging
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations
- Development: Local SQLite database
- Staging: Staging database with sample data
- Production: Production database with backups
